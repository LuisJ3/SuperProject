Minutes
- We discussed leadership of the group.
	Team Leader: William
	Secretary: Noelle
- We determined that team leaders will be rotated every two weeks to give everyone leadership experience.
- We compiled a list of questions regarding project requirements.
- We verified that we could all communicate using the Slack application.
- Bianca demonstrated GUI implementation with JFrame for those unfamiliar with NetBeans.
- Noelle and Bianca asked Professor Marian Gheorghe a list of questions created earlier.  T
	- Essentially, we need to come up with a simple yet efficient implementation that makes sense.
	- The data will be manually entered by a person on one line.  Extra features like entering information from a file could be added later.
	- Validation of data is expected.  We should not allow text when we expect a UB number, and we should not allow a studentâ€™s name to have numbers in it.
	- Professor Gheorghe also mentioned that suggesting new features to a client during the first meeting is not wise because client's hopes might be set unreasonably high.
